# Model Training Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Database field name mismatches**
   - Fixed incorrect field references in database queries:
     - Changed `projectId` to `project`
     - Changed `imageId` to `image`
   - These changes ensure proper database relationships are maintained

2. **Path handling for image files**
   - Added code to handle image paths with leading slashes
   - Implemented more robust path resolution for cross-platform compatibility
   - Improved error reporting for missing files

3. **Image dimension handling**
   - Switched from using the `image-size` library to using dimensions stored in database
   - This approach is more reliable and avoids file system access issues
   - Added validation to ensure dimensions are available before processing annotations

4. **Error handling and validation**
   - Added MongoDB ObjectId format validation for project IDs
   - Improved error messages with more details about what went wrong
   - Added logging of the specific issues encountered during training preparation

5. **Training workflow validation**
   - Created comprehensive test scripts to verify each step of the process
   - Added tests for database connections, annotation processing, and training initialization

6. **Detection Server Status Management**
   - Added endpoints to check and control detection server status
   - Created server status indicator component for frontend
   - Implemented automated server status checking before training
   - Added capability to manually start the detection server from the UI

7. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added detailed error messages for common training failures
   - Implemented client-side detection server status verification
   - Improved error display with toast notifications instead of alert boxes
   - Added specific guidance for common error cases (CUDA errors, missing files, etc.)

8. **Training Status Tracking**
   - Improved status reporting for training jobs with detailed progress information
   - Added error detection and reporting in the training process
   - Implemented model file verification to ensure training completed successfully
   - Enhanced user feedback with toast notifications and status indicators

## How to Verify

Use the provided test scripts to verify that the fixes are working correctly:

1. **Database connection test**
   ```
   node scripts/test-db-connection.js
   ```
   - Confirms MongoDB connection works
   - Verifies project, image, and annotation models are correctly defined
   - Checks that sample data exists

2. **Training data preparation test**
   ```
   node scripts/test-training-data.js
   ```
   - Tests the process of collecting and transforming training data
   - Verifies annotation conversion to YOLO format works

3. **Complete training workflow test**
   ```
   node scripts/test-complete-training-workflow.js [projectId]
   ```
   
4. **Detection server status**
   ```
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/detection/server-status
   ```
   - Verifies the detection server status checking functionality
   - Should return a JSON object with server status details

5. **Manual testing of UI**
   - Visit the training page in the UI
   - Verify that the server status indicator shows correctly
   - Test starting the detection server from the UI
   - Attempt to train a model and verify error handling

## Frontend Testing

To test the complete workflow from the frontend:

1. Go to the Training page
2. Select a project with images and annotations
3. Configure training parameters
4. Start the training process
5. Monitor the training progress in the logs

If any issues persist, check the browser console and server logs for detailed error messages.
